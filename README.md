# Hyperblox
Hyperblox is a former attempt at a Roblox revival that ultimately didn't succeed. It was a project born out of the revival community but couldn't stay online for long.

# Why is this here?
The project was shut down a while ago. The source code provided here is primarily the website's frontend, consisting mostly of HTML files. There isn't a complex backend or a functional client included.

I am sharing this simply for archival purposes—in case someone comes across it and wants to examine the code or see what the project looked like.
